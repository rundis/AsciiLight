AsciiLight is a simple plugin for displaying a preview of http://asciidoctor.org[AsciiDoctor] documents. It uses the
https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor.js[asciidoctor.js] npm module for doing most of the hard work.

== Installation
Install through the LightTable plugin manager.


== Usage
With your .adoc file open, open the command bar in (ctrl+space/cmd+space) and select
*AsciiLight: Watch this editor for changes*
